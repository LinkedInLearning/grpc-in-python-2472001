gRPC allows clients and server applications to communicate more efficiently on a connected system. Knowing how to use gRPC can come in handy if youâ€™re programming in a language like Python. In this course designed uniquely for Python developers, instructor Miki Tebeka shows you the essentials of gRPC so you can get started with this easy-to-use tool.

Get a brief introduction to gRPC and the working parts of its ecosystem: protocol buffers, HTTP/2-based transport, .proto files, enumerations, nested types, and JSON encoding. Learn how to run the gRPC server, create a gRPC client, define a streaming end point to send data to the client, and handle streaming responses from the server. Along the way, Miki gives you tips on using tools like interceptors and gRPC Gateway.


## Installing
1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
	- [Python](https://python.org/) (from version 3.8 and up)
    - The [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) compiler
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
3. You'll also need to install the external Python dependencies, see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). You can use the `create_env.py` script to generate a virtual environment. During the course we'll be using [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl), you can install it via your package manager (e.g. `brew`, `apt`, `choco` ...) or from [the release section](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/releases)
